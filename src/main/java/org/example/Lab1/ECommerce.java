          Each class in the code is responsible for only one thing:
          - PaymentProcessor only processes payments, it doesnâ€™t care about the payment method logic.
         - Each payment method class (e.g., CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment) handles its own payment-specific logic.
         This follows the SRP by keeping each class focused on a single responsibility. */
